            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 20px;">
                My journey into web and game development started when I was fascinated by how interactive 
                experiences could bring joy and solve real-world problems. What began as curiosity about 
                "how websites work" evolved into a passion for creating both beautiful web applications 
                and immersive gaming experiences.

                    <h3>🌐 Web Development</h3>
                    <p>I specialize in building responsive, user-friendly web applications using modern 
                    frameworks like React, Vue, and Node.js. From e-commerce platforms to interactive 
                    dashboards, I focus on creating seamless user experiences.</p>

                    <h3>🎮 Game Development</h3>
                    <p>Creating games is where creativity meets technology. I develop 2D and 3D games 
                    using Unity and Godot, focusing on engaging gameplay mechanics, smooth performance, 
                    and compelling narratives.</p>

                    <p>Whether debugging complex code or designing intuitive interfaces, I thrive on 
                    solving challenging problems. I approach every project with analytical thinking 
                    and creative solutions.</p>

            <h2>My Approach</h2>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 20px;">
                I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and creating experiences that users love. 
                Every project is an opportunity to learn something new and push the boundaries of what's 
                possible. I'm constantly exploring new technologies, contributing to open source, and 
                sharing knowledge with the developer community.

            <h2>When I'm Not Coding</h2>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 20px;">
                You'll find me playing indie games for inspiration, attending game jams, experimenting 
                with new frameworks, or mentoring aspiring developers. I'm also an avid reader of tech 
                blogs and enjoy participating in hackathons and developer meetups.
